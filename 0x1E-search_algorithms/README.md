# Project 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This project is about implementing various search algorithms in C.

## Description

In this project, I learnt how to use and compare different search algorithms, such as linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, exponential search, and advanced binary search. I also learnt how to apply these algorithms to different data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and skip lists. I also learnt how to analyze the time and space complexity of these algorithms.
